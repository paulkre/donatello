# Donatello

This repository contains a virtual reality sculpting application developed in [Unity3D](https://unity.com/). It is a research project conducted at the University of Applied Sciences DÃ¼sseldorf with the goal to compare different types of interactions with enterprise applications in VR. 

For this purpose the application can be controlled in two different ways. The first type of interaction are Odyssey's motion controllers and the second type is a way to interact with the application via the user's hands and fingers. For the second type, other students at the UoASD developed an optical finger-tracking solution which has not been implemented yet and will follow in future versions.

For debugging, the application can also be executed in a desktop environment, controlled via mouse and keyboard. This is helpful to test and present new functionalities.
