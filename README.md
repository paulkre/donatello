This repository contains a virtual reality sculpting application developed in [Unity3D](https://unity.com/). It is subject of a research project conducted at the University of Applied Sciences DÃ¼sseldorf with the goal to compare different types of interaction modalities in virtual-reality enterprise applications. 

For this purpose the application can be controlled in two different ways. The first type of interaction is the use of the Odyssey's motion controllers and the second way of interaction the use of hands and fingers. For the second type, other students at the UoASD developed an optical finger-tracking solution which has not been implemented yet and will follow in future versions.

For debugging, the application can also be executed in a desktop environment, controlled via mouse and keyboard. This is helpful to test and present new functionalities.
